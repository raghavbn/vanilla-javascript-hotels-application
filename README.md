# vanilla-javascript-hotels-application
This is a plain javascript application for the Hotels.com Top Destinations page.
To run this code, download the application and open index.html on a browser.
This application has the following:
- index.html file which is the base of the application from where everything is instantiated.
- index.js file is the main file that has the code to render the accordions and to handle accordion toggle on the page.
- style.css file where all the user styles are listed. the size of this can be further reduced by running a grunt task to minify this file.
- images folder that holds all the images shared in the exercise.

This application uses the following:
- bootstrap for the page to adapt to device width. the size of the bootstrap file downloaded can be further reduced by only downloading the grid component in bootstrap if it needs further reduction.
- jQuery to query and manipulate the DOM.
- underscore is used as a template engine to combine the markup and the data and render the body of the page.
